# local_ceteicean
This repository supports my teaching of XML and GitHub publishing tools for an Introduction to Digital Humanities course.

It contains a fork of Barry Clark's Jekyll Now repository, plus a localized version of the TEI CETEIcean tool for publishing XML in a browser. The localized version is modified so that it can work with students' own XML rather than with TEI.
